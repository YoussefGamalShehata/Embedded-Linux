1- Red Hat - Keil - Fedora - Ubuntu

2- man command is very useful comman which is used to show us the reference manuels for commands but only used with External commands only.

3-  rm >>> is command that remove Files and Directories it is also used to remove a directory with is files in using recursive tag ( rm -r mydir)  this will remove mydir and its files
    rmdir >>> only used to remove Empty Directories but it can remove non Empty Directory using alsi reursive tag (rmdir -r mydir)
4- (we are in /home/youssef) >>>>> 
    mkdir dir1
    mkdir docs
    (director Documents is already exist at my home so i will not create Documents Directory)
    *Creating dir11 and dir12 Directories inside dir1 Directory*
    cd dir1
    mkdir dir11
    mkdir dir12
    *Creating file1 dir11 Directory*
    cd dir11
    touch file1
    *Creating mycv inside docs Directory*
    cd ../docs
    touch mycv
    *Creating OldFiles inside Documents Directory*
    cd ../Documents
    touch OldFiles
  4-a (Removing dir11 with rmdir in one step) >>>> when using rmdir command to remove dir11 it give ms "Failed to remove : Directory is not Empty" So the we can overcome this using
       Recursive Tag so the command line will be as following : rmdir -r dir11 
       Note : we should be at the directory dir1 to get the chance removing dir11 otherwise the system will not recognise dir11

  4-b it gives me "Failed to remove OldFiles : Not a Directory"

  4-c Absloute Path >>>> Must be start with root directory which will be : /home/user/docs/mycv
      Relative Path >>>> docs/mycv

5- cp /etc/passwd ~/mypasswd

9- type command is internal command that used to show us the type of any command (Internal - External - Hashed) and information about the commands according to shell
   for Example if i write type cd it gives me "cd is a shell builtin" that means that cd is Internal Command to shell.

10- find /usr/bin -maxdepth 1 -type f -name 'c*' | head -n 2 >>>> Not by myself i searched to get it
    find /usr/bin >> start searching inside this path 
    -maxdepth 1 >>> pervent the finding to go through subdirectories it will be only limited to find in the files and directories in this path
    -type f >>>> to excludes the finding on directories by this i forced him to find only in files not files and directories
    -name c >>>> means that finding will be limited to the files starting with 'c' we can say that it is a filter
    head -n 2 >>>> limits the output of the find to only for 2 lines which leads that the output will be only 2 types as required

11- man -k "readfile"
    it gives me "nothing appropriate"

12- apropos command is similer command to man command it is also considered as one of the help commands but not commonly used.
